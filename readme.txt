Spend less time managing eBay Partner Network ads and let our tools do the work for you

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to embed eBay items on your WordPress site and earn commissions through your eBay Partner Network (ePN) account. If you do not already have a ePN account you must <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.ebaypartnernetwork.com">create one</a> in order to use this plugin.

The plugin is reliable, super fast, highly customizable and has no up-front fees. Instead of asking users to pay for the service, 15% of links to eBay will use the Auction Affiliate campaign ID (the tracking code which ties in with your ePN account) This means you have a 85% share of revenue generated by the plugin.

The plugin has two tools for displaying eBay items on your site:

* **Item Lister** - display multiple items at once on your page. The listings have their own "Next" and "Previous" buttons so users can navigate through multiple pages of items. How the items are displayed is very customizable
* **Item Banner** - display items as interactive banner ads, available in a range of standard banner sizes

The tools can display items by either adding shortcodes (`[auction-affiliate tool="lister"]` or `[auction-affiliate tool="banner"]`) within your content editor, or by adding them as widgets to any widgetized area within your theme.

Please refer to the Auction Affiliate <a href="http://www.auctionaffiliate.co/docs/clients/wordpress">WordPress plugin page</a> for full documentation and help.

== Installation ==

Please refer to the Auction Affiliate <a href="http://www.auctionaffiliate.co/docs/clients/wordpress">WordPress plugin page</a> for full documentation and help.

= Adding Auction Affiliate to pages / posts =

Once the Auction Affiliate plugin has been enabled, a new box will appear on the edit page/post admin screen. This allows you to specify which eBay items to display on your page, through a number of powerful options and filters. Here you also specify your affiliate tracking information and decide how your items should look. Some of these options can be set as defaults on the Admin > Settings > Auction Affiliate page, so you do not have to enter them for every page.

You can then add the appropriate shortcode to your content editor where you would like the items to appear. The shortcode for the Item Lister looks like this: 

`
[auction-affiliate tool="lister"]`

Multiple shortcodes can be added to each page (see below for more information)

= Multiple shortcodes =

As well as specifying where listings should appear on your page, shortcodes can be manually passed options to specify what items appear on the page. This can be useful when you wish to add multiple listings to the same page, or add them to your theme instead of within the content editor.

Any options passed through a shortcode override any options specified on that page, as well as any default options set through the Auction Affiliate settings page.

Passing options to shortcodes can be achieved like so:

`
[auction-affiliate tool="lister" eKeyword="iPad mini case" eSite="0" eCount="4"]`

As an example, say you want to display two sets of items â€“ one showing six iPhones and one showing three iPads. If you want all other settings to be the same (i.e. the eBay site, your ePN custom ID, the theme etc) then you can set up the common options in the Auction Affiliate options box and then specifying two different shortcodes like so:

`
[auction-affiliate tool="lister" eKeyword="iPhone" eCount="6"]

[auction-affiliate tool="lister" eKeyword="iPad" eCount="3"]`

Refer to the <a href="http://www.auctionaffiliate.co/docs/parameters">parameters page</a> for an explanation of each parameter and allowed values.

= Adding Auction Affiliate as widgets =

You can add the Auction Affiliate Item Lister and Item Banner tools as widgets to any widgetized area in your theme through Admin > Appearance > Widgets and selecting the appropriate tool.

= Adding Auction Affiliate within your theme =

To add Auction Affiliate items within your theme files, you must use the shortcode format described above and pass it to the WordPress `do_shortcode()` function like so:

`
<?php echo do_shortcode('[auction-affiliate tool="lister" eKeyword="iPad mini case" eSite="0" eCount="4"]'); ?>`

= Specifying defaults =

Default settings for some Auction Affiliate options can be specified on the Admin > Settings > Auction Affiliate page.

If specified, these defaults save you from repeatedly entering the same option each time you add Auction Affiliate to your pages or posts. Defaults can easily be overridden on a page-by-page basis. You are able to specify the following default values:

* eBay Site
* EPN Campaign ID
* EPN Custom ID
* Theme
* Primary Colour
* Secondary Colour
* Background Colour

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Please refer to the Auction Affiliate <a href="http://www.auctionaffiliate.co/help">help page</a> for more information

= Do I need to be a eBay Partner Network member? =

Yes, in order to use Auction Affiliate you must provide a eBay Partner Network (ePN) campaign ID linked to your account. This ensures clicks of links generated by Auction Affiliate are associated with your ePN account.

You can read more information and apply for an account at the official <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.ebaypartnernetwork.com">eBay Partner Network website</a>.

= Is there an option to cloak roverized affiliate links? =

Not at this time. Some affiliates may prefer to cloak roverized links to eBay so links appear to be to the same domain which are then redirected to eBay once clicked.

This is a feature I am considering adding but for now all links are roverized and contain the `rel="nofollow"` attribute for SEO purposes.

= How can I modify the appearance of Auction Affiliate? =

As well as choosing from different themes and choosing a primary/secondary/background colour you can also change the appearance using simple CSS rules.

You can change the CSS rules for Auction Affiliate by specifying new rules in your style sheet. As a quick example, to make all of the product titles red and italic you would add this rule to your style sheet :

`/* Make the item title link red and italic  */
.aa-container .aa-item .aa-title a {
  color: red;
  font-style: italic;
}`

All themes can be adjusted in this way.

= How often does Auction Affiliate update? =

To reduce server load and to improve page load performance, Auction Affiliate does not update every time it is loaded on your site. Instead it updates every 60 minutes. This means Auction Affiliate will load super fast on your site!

= How can I increase the size of item images? =

Item images can be increased in size by using CSS to overwrite the dimensions set by Auction Affiliate. To alter these dimensions add the following CSS rule to your stylesheet, changing the values as desired:

`/* Increase the size of your item images  */
.aa-container .aa-img-wrap {
  width: 140px !important;
  height: 140px !important;
}`

It is recommended that the width and height values are the same so the image does not become distorted.
