Spend less time managing eBay Partner Network ads and let our tools do the work for you

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to embed eBay items on your WordPress site and earn commissions through your eBay Partner Network (ePN) account. If you do not already have a ePN account you must <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.ebaypartnernetwork.com">create one</a> in order to use this plugin.

The plugin is reliable, super fast, highly customizable and free to use. Instead of asking users to pay for the service, 15% of links to eBay will use the Auction Affiliate campaign ID (the tracking code which ties in with your ePN account) This means you have a 85% share of revenue generated by the plugin.

Please refer to the Auction Affiliate <a href="http://www.auctionaffiliate.co/docs/clients/wordpress">WordPress plugin page</a> for full documentation and help.

== Installation ==

Please refer to the Auction Affiliate <a href="http://www.auctionaffiliate.co/docs/clients/wordpress">WordPress plugin page</a> for full documentation and help.

= Adding Auction Affiliate to pages / posts =

Once the Auction Affiliate plugin has been enabled, a new box will appear in admin when adding or editing a page or post.

This box gives you sets of options which are used to specify what items are pulled in from eBay, how it is tied to your eBay Partner Network (ePN) account and how they are displayed on your page.

Once you have specified these options, you can place the marker `[auction-affiliate]` (known as a 'shortcode') in to your post content editor to specify where the listings will appear.

= Specifying defaults =

Default settings for some Auction Affiliate options can be specified on the Admin > Settings > Auction Affiliate page.

If specified, these defaults save you from repeatedly entering the same option each time you add Auction Affiliate to your pages or posts. Defaults can easily be overridden on a page-by-page basis. You are able to specify the following default values:

* eBay Site
* EPN Campaign ID
* EPN Custom ID
* Theme
* Primary Colour
* Secondary Colour
* Background Colour

= Using shortcodes =

As well as specifying where listings should appear on your page, shortcodes can be manually passed options to specify what items appear on the page. This can be useful when you wish to add multiple listings to the same page, or add them to your theme instead of within the post content editor.

Any options passed through a shortcode override any options specified on that page / post and any default options set through the Auction Affiliate settings page.

Passing options to shortcodes can be achieved like so:

`[auction-affiliate eKeyword="iPad mini case" eSite="0" eCount="4"]`

Refer to the <a href="http://www.auctionaffiliate.co/docs/parameters">parameters documentation</a> for an explanation of each parameter and allowed values.

= Adding Auction Affiliate within your theme =

To add Auction Affiliate items within your theme files, you must use the shortcode format described above and pass it to the WordPress do_shortcode() function like so:

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[auction-affiliate eKeyword="iPad mini case" eSite="0" eCount="4"]'); ?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Please refer to the Auction Affiliate <a href="http://www.auctionaffiliate.co/help">help page</a> for more information

= Do I need to be a eBay Partner Network member? =

Yes, in order to use Auction Affiliate you must provide a eBay Partner Network (ePN) campaign ID linked to your account. This ensures clicks of links generated by Auction Affiliate are associated with your ePN account.

You can read more information and apply for an account at the official <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.ebaypartnernetwork.com">eBay Partner Network website</a>.

= Is there an option to cloak roverized affiliate links? =

Not at this time. Some affiliates may prefer to cloak roverized links to eBay so links appear to be to the same domain which are then redirected to eBay once clicked.

This is a feature I am considering adding but for now all links are roverized and contain the `rel="nofollow"` attribute for SEO purposes.

= How can I modify the appearance of Auction Affiliate? =

As well as choosing from different themes and choosing a primary/secondary/background colour you can also change the appearance using simple CSS rules.

You can change the CSS rules for Auction Affiliate by specifying new rules in your style sheet. As a quick example, to make all of the product titles red and italic you would add this rule to your style sheet :

`/* Make the item title link red and italic  */
.aa-container .aa-item .aa-title a {
  color: red;
  font-style: italic;
}`

All themes can be adjusted in this way.

= How often does Auction Affiliate update? =

To reduce server load and to improve page load performance, Auction Affiliate does not update every time it is loaded on your site. Instead it updates every 60 minutes.

= How can I increase the size of item images? =

Item images can be increased in size by using CSS to overwrite the dimensions set by Auction Affiliate. To alter these dimensions add the following CSS rule to your stylesheet, changing the values as desired:

`/* Increase the size of your item images  */
.aa-container .aa-img-wrap {
  width: 140px !important;
  height: 140px !important;
}`

It is recommended that the width and height values are the same so the image does not become distorted.
